<p><strong>How do teens today understand <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">cloud file transfer</a> and sharing? Is it like a playground and having your friends close by all the time?</strong></p>
<p>Jenny who is a 15 year old scholar student and a sophomore in high school, shared her excitement to her group of friends about searching for her lost dog by using the <em>Guru Transfer</em> app, for sharing files with the world. Additionally she stated that having <em>Guru Transfer</em> on her mobile devices is like having at your disposal the entire school and even students from other schools from all ends of the earth.</p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJacMJqTgPI?start=33&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>You can activate only the people you want to.</strong></p>
<p>She added that the people that know my dog can recognize him. They can search all over the neighborhood and can share the dog&#8217;s details with the rest of the people.</p>
<p>While some of them are scouring the streets, I can make some active, as many as you consider necessary, spreading leaflets to convenience stores, as many as you need looking on the streets, as many as you need calling people from the nearby towns to see if they have seen my dog.</p>
<p><strong>You can always move people from one team to the other or dismantle a team and distributing the people from that team to do another task.</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_1373" style="width: 267px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><img class="wp-image-1373 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/images-4.jpg" alt="images-4" width="267" height="189" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><em>Get the Free Guru Transfer app here</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The number of the people involved is elastic, and you can re-distribute them from a task to a different task whenever you want wherever you want. As long as the search is done and I found my dog, everybody goes offline, not active anymore, going back to their homes.</p>
<p>The cloud with file transfer and sharing and storage is not only changing the world’s lives, but as well changing how our children are now interacting, studying, and so much more. The way our children play, learn, and interact with others and the world around them is a wonderful innovation.</p>
<p>And, when our children go online to communicate by email or play games via online software applications they are using the cloud! Unlike the outdoor playground, which is in some cases injury and physical risks can occur as kids will be kids, the cloud now is a <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">safe and secure place</a> without the risk of being exposed when they use cloud-based applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/cloud-file-transfer-comes-cycle-high-schools">A similar article shows us how cloud file transfer is is becoming a high school hit&#8230;</a></p>
<p><strong>After all, shouldn’t the cloud be a private and safe place for our kids these days?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohitsrivastava">See LinkedIn where</a> <em>GuruTransfer.com</em> founder, Rohit Srivastava tells us more. We live in a society where we share increasing amounts of information about ourselves and children are doing the same.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1286" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><img class="wp-image-1286 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/images-1-2.jpg" alt="images-1" width="274" height="184" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><em>itunes from the Apple store</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Increasingly cloud storage has become a way of life especially for older children. Children are using <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/"><em>Guru Transfer</em></a> file transfer and cloud storage to backup or migrate their music, their contacts, their photos, even video, and more, giving them the convenience of anywhere, anytime and access on any device.</p>
<p>Having the <em>Guru Transfer</em> app means that instead of all the computer hardware and software you&#8217;re using taking up space on your desktop, or somewhere inside your  network, it&#8217;s provided for you as a service by another company and accessed over the Internet, while you are on the go travelling anywhere in the world, in a completely seamless way.</p>

<p><strong>He had to find a <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">file transfer service</a> powerful enough to address important needs, Cloud File Transfer gets Students around Learning Curve</strong></p>
<p>These files needed space and when Byron Smith school teacher at a public high school learned the story of a shy girl who found the courage to speak up with the help of her computer, he knew he needed to make a change.</p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJacMJqTgPI?start=33&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For some, cloud file transfer is an amorphous issue. For Mr. Smith, its definition was simple: technology the school may use without owning hardware. The teachers at the school had more ideas on how to use cloud file transfer for his student’s needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to replicate content for all the students and get files to the students as well,&#8221; Smith explains. &#8220;This way, the work the students were involved in would be available at network speed from home or at their desks in school, or anywhere on the planet for that matter from their mobile device.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1415" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><img class="wp-image-1415 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/images-2-3.jpg" alt="images-2" width="225" height="225" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><em>Download the Free Guru Transfer app</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>He needed extra space and he needed to stay within the limits of his school’s privacy policy.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Children have to be protected, but we also need to <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">help them move</a> forward,&#8221; Smith says.</p>
<p>The learning curve for the students is not just with the training or lesson plans of the kids, who were born into a constantly changing technological world, but rather with training their teachers, all teachers agreed.</p>
<p>The school’s administration recommends adding a professional development focus for switching over to the cloud and allowing enough time for repetitive learning.</p>
<p>Smith a teacher of over 25 years admits he has used cloud-based aspects in recent years, but this complete overhaul meant losing the headaches of updating and installing. From a management standpoint, the pros of putting schools in the cloud, are streamlining work and making files accessible for students and staff. The school also works with the technology education company it&#8217;s learning, which has a one-stop portal for all resources. Cloud File Transfer gets Students around Learning Curve and has been chosen with proven success.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/cloud-classroom-replacing-contemporary-studies">A sister article shows us how cloud file transfer is more and more coming to the classroom&#8230;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We have the <em>Guru Transfer</em> app as our cloud file transfer and storage service for all students and staff,&#8221; Smith says, and he adds that the students are using the file transfer options for a bit more than their lesson plans and assignments.</p>
<p><strong>For example, we certainly do see that the kids are sharing videos and their favorite itunes.</strong></p>
<p>But that’s okay because the learning curve being more easily rounded with the <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/"><em>Guru Transfer</em> app</a> is what we’re really after. After all, kids will be kids and that won’t change. Smith also admitted the excitement the teachers and staff are feeling in their own personal use of the app.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1185" style="width: 199px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><img class="wp-image-1185 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/images-1.jpg" alt="images-1" width="199" height="254" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><em>itunes from the Apple store</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s certain that students spend a lot of time taking tests. There are end-of-semester tests, end-of-year tests, subject matter tests, aptitude tests, state tests, national tests, and college aptitude tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohitsrivastava">Hop over to LinkedIn </a>and see where <em>GuruTransfer.com</em> founder, Rihit Srivastava tell us more how the list is endless to a willing to learn as well as a stressed-out teenager.</p>
<p>So by allowing the students to study in groups by way of cloud file transfer, can often make those tests seem to be less stressful, and we can rid the student of the consequences for not doing well.</p>

<p><strong>Becoming an entrepreneur is a dream for many and an aspiration or goal you hear over top of 9-5 cubicles in everyday work stations. </strong></p>
<p>But starting your own business isn&#8217;t all bright sunny days and miles of freedom. Often the entrepreneur will be met with a struggle around every corner.</p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJacMJqTgPI?start=33&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Being her own boss&#8221; is something that can eat away at your confidence is what Marsha discovered, when she left her 40 hour a week—and get all the overtime you can mindset safe-haven that only left her complacent in life.</p>
<p>Marsha found quickly that running a profitable and successful company is an incredibly trying experience that takes dedication, hard work, and sacrifice. She decided that she would be one of the entrepreneurs who are celebrated. Marsha was out to prove that entrepreneurs are the ones that get up every day and make the world a place of hope and free will for everyone else.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/cloud-file-sharing-storage-secured-disaster-strikes">A similar article shows how the cloud helps entrepreneurs be prepared if disaster hits&#8230;</a></p>
<p><strong>When Marsha discovered cloud file sharing and storage options she found a security blanket.</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_880" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><img class="wp-image-880 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/images-3.jpg" alt="images" width="225" height="225" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile">Get the Free Guru Transfer app here</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>She found that when storing data in the cloud enabled her to secure access to data, using all devices such as tablet, smartphone and PC operating on the same system. This means entrepreneurs can maximize their efficiency by getting the access to information, using any device they have, at any given moment.</p>
<p>Marsha, being tight on startup cash found greater flexibility and reduced upfront costs making <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">cloud technology</a> a natural fit for her marketing shop, being that cloud simplifies the IT processes and accelerates the growth curve.</p>
<p><strong>A simple situation with Marsha described the immense potential of cloud file sharing and storage with <em>Guru Transfer</em>: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>She reached the client site to present a deal, but forgot to carry an important fact sheet that defines the success of the deal. Before leaving for the meeting she shifted the required data to the cloud which helped to access the data right at her fingertips at the client&#8217;s site.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cloud file sharing and storage with <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><em>Guru Transfer</em> </a>excludes the need for onsite servers—taking away with it operating costs and extra space required for storage of onsite servers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The need for managing the network and information by devoted onsite staff diminishes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Marsha, this leads to improved cost efficiency.</p>
<p>Almost every entrepreneur shares the same experience as Marsha that it is practically not possible to execute business processes smoothly without a reliable network, computer and associated equipment.</p>
<p><strong>It is often difficult for an average entrepreneur to keep its network up dated and maintain smooth functioning of software and other tools.</strong></p>
<p>By making the move to the cloud, entrepreneurs need not to bank upon guesswork.</p>
<figure id="attachment_861" style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><img class="wp-image-861" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GuruTransfer.com-1-1.jpg" alt="gurutransfer-com-1" width="318" height="159" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><em>itunes from the Apple store</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohitsrivastava">See LinkedIn where</a> <em>Guru Transfer </em>founder, Rohit Srivastava tells us about delivering an immediate resolution to any kind of troubleshooting and repairing issue.</p>
<p>Just like for Marsha, this enables entrepreneurs to focus more on running their business smoothly, instead of devoting time in performing research on servers and building the infrastructure.</p>
<p>What Marsha liked best is her confidence with security issues that can often be an additional expense for an entrepreneur. But the<a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"> improved productivity </a>and big savings with <em>Guru Transfer</em> overcomes the risks. This helps entrepreneurs to focus on delivering the best services which facilitates the growth of their businesses and maximize efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Being away at college and <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">staying in touch</a> with the people you have left behind can cause student blues and feeling pretty well homesick.</strong></p>
<p>Cindy left her large and close family in upstate New York for college in the UK, and realized she needed to give herself time within the university and the British environment to begin getting involved there.</p>
<p>For Cindy beginning life at college naturally generated both excitement and anxiety for many reasons, including the move. After all, just months ago she graduated from high school and with her new academic responsibilities and meeting new people certainly was stressful. But she knew she would be fine in due time.</p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJacMJqTgPI?start=33&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>To her surprise she found herself feeling homesick later in the academic year, after the Thanksgiving or semester break, and even at the start of her second academic year.</p>
<p><strong>Then Cindy found the <em>Guru Transfer</em> cloud app perfect for families.</strong></p>
<p>Families can take advantage of the ease at which you can share files, even video, using cloud storage to keep in touch with children who are away at college or family members who live out of state or abroad. Collaboration is much easier when families store their documentation in a cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/cloud-file-sharing-lighting-students-globally">A related article tells how the cloud is lighting up students globally&#8230;</a></p>
<p>Individual family members can all upload their suggestions to the cloud to make decision making more of a collaborative effort. Cloud sharing and storage also comes in useful when on a family holiday too.</p>

<p>Consider sharing files where families can take advantage of the ease at which you can share even large files.  Using cloud storage to keep in touch with children who are away at college or family members who live out of state or abroad is quick and easy.</p>
<p>Rather than having to email multiple files individually or in groups to family members, which is both time consuming for the receiver and the sender, you can send them one email with a URL on it. This will give them full access to all the files you want them to see.</p>
<p>Accidents happen, theft occurs and loss of files or devices is an eventuality, but the severity of the outcome can be limited thanks to <em>Guru Transfer</em> cloud storage.</p>
<p>Family <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">cloud storage and file sharing</a> is fantastic for making sure that not only are everyone&#8217;s documents safe, but also that you can keep in touch with ease.</p>
<p><strong>With Cindy’s big family back home the cloud keeps the other kids still at home happy, too. </strong></p>
<p>Smartphones or tablets with access to your <em>Guru Transfer</em> cloud storage are a prime example of this. Through your cloud you can choose a film to play out to keep your children happy whilst on a long car journey.</p>

<p><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohitsrivastava">Pop over to LinkedIn</a> and see GuruTransfer.co founder, Rohit Srivastava explain more.</p>
<p>Cloud storage is the easiest way for Cindy away at college abroad to keep in touch with her parents and her dear Grandma, and to share pictures or video of the holiday happenings with everyone.</p>
<p>Automated backup can ensure that all your family’s devices backup to the same cloud with no manual effort required. Keep in mind that accidents do happen, theft occurs and loss of files or devices is an eventuality, but the severity of the outcome can be limited thanks to <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/"><em>Guru Transfer</em></a> cloud storage and file sharing.</p>
