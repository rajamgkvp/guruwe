<div class="entry-content">
<p><strong>He had to find a <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">file transfer service</a> powerful enough to address important needs.</strong></p>
<p>These files needed space and when Byron Smith school teacher at a public high school learned the story of a shy girl who found the courage to speak up with the help of her computer, he knew he needed to make a change.</p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJacMJqTgPI?start=33&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For some, cloud file transfer is an amorphous issue. For Mr. Smith, its definition was simple: technology the school may use without owning hardware. The teachers at the school had more ideas on how to use cloud file transfer for his student’s needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to replicate content for all the students and get files to the students as well,&#8221; Smith explains. &#8220;This way, the work the students were involved in would be available at network speed from home or at their desks in school, or anywhere on the planet for that matter from their mobile device.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1415" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><img class="wp-image-1415 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/images-2-3.jpg" alt="images-2" width="225" height="225" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><em>Download the Free Guru Transfer app</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>He needed extra space and he needed to stay within the limits of his school’s privacy policy.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Children have to be protected, but we also need to <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">help them move</a> forward,&#8221; Smith says.</p>
<p>The learning curve for the students is not just with the training or lesson plans of the kids, who were born into a constantly changing technological world, but rather with training their teachers, all teachers agreed.</p>
<p>The school’s administration recommends adding a professional development focus for switching over to the cloud and allowing enough time for repetitive learning.</p>
<p>Smith a teacher of over 25 years admits he has used cloud-based aspects in recent years, but this complete overhaul meant losing the headaches of updating and installing. From a management standpoint, the pros of putting schools in the cloud, are streamlining work and making files accessible for students and staff. The school also works with the technology education company it&#8217;s learning, which has a one-stop portal for all resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/cloud-classroom-replacing-contemporary-studies">A sister article shows us how cloud file transfer is more and more coming to the classroom&#8230;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We have the <em>Guru Transfer</em> app as our cloud file transfer and storage service for all students and staff,&#8221; Smith says, and he adds that the students are using the file transfer options for a bit more than their lesson plans and assignments.</p>
<p><strong>For example, we certainly do see that the kids are sharing videos and their favorite itunes.</strong></p>
<p>But that’s okay because the learning curve being more easily rounded with the <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/"><em>Guru Transfer</em> app</a> is what we’re really after. After all, kids will be kids and that won’t change. Smith also admitted the excitement the teachers and staff are feeling in their own personal use of the app.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1185" style="width: 199px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><img class="wp-image-1185 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/images-1.jpg" alt="images-1" width="199" height="254" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><em>itunes from the Apple store</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s certain that students spend a lot of time taking tests. There are end-of-semester tests, end-of-year tests, subject matter tests, aptitude tests, state tests, national tests, and college aptitude tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohitsrivastava">Hop over to LinkedIn </a>and see where <em>GuruTransfer.com</em> founder, Rihit Srivastava tell us more how the list is endless to a willing to learn as well as a stressed-out teenager.</p>
<p>So by allowing the students to study in groups by way of cloud file transfer, can often make those tests seem to be less stressful, and we can rid the student of the consequences for not doing well.</p>

<p><strong>Becoming an entrepreneur is a dream for many and an aspiration or goal you hear over top of 9-5 cubicles in everyday work stations. </strong></p>
<p>But starting your own business isn&#8217;t all bright sunny days and miles of freedom. Often the entrepreneur will be met with a struggle around every corner.</p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJacMJqTgPI?start=33&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Being her own boss&#8221; is something that can eat away at your confidence is what Marsha discovered, when she left her 40 hour a week—and get all the overtime you can mindset safe-haven that only left her complacent in life.</p>
<p>Marsha found quickly that running a profitable and successful company is an incredibly trying experience that takes dedication, hard work, and sacrifice. She decided that she would be one of the entrepreneurs who are celebrated. Marsha was out to prove that entrepreneurs are the ones that get up every day and make the world a place of hope and free will for everyone else.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/cloud-file-sharing-storage-secured-disaster-strikes">A similar article shows how the cloud helps entrepreneurs be prepared if disaster hits&#8230;</a></p>
<p><strong>When Marsha discovered cloud file sharing and storage options she found a security blanket.</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_880" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><img class="wp-image-880 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/images-3.jpg" alt="images" width="225" height="225" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile">Get the Free Guru Transfer app here</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>She found that when storing data in the cloud enabled her to secure access to data, using all devices such as tablet, smartphone and PC operating on the same system. This means entrepreneurs can maximize their efficiency by getting the access to information, using any device they have, at any given moment.</p>
<p>Marsha, being tight on startup cash found greater flexibility and reduced upfront costs making <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">cloud technology</a> a natural fit for her marketing shop, being that cloud simplifies the IT processes and accelerates the growth curve.</p>
<p><strong>A simple situation with Marsha described the immense potential of cloud file sharing and storage with <em>Guru Transfer</em>: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>She reached the client site to present a deal, but forgot to carry an important fact sheet that defines the success of the deal. Before leaving for the meeting she shifted the required data to the cloud which helped to access the data right at her fingertips at the client&#8217;s site.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cloud file sharing and storage with <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><em>Guru Transfer</em> </a>excludes the need for onsite servers—taking away with it operating costs and extra space required for storage of onsite servers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The need for managing the network and information by devoted onsite staff diminishes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Marsha, this leads to improved cost efficiency.</p>
<p>Almost every entrepreneur shares the same experience as Marsha that it is practically not possible to execute business processes smoothly without a reliable network, computer and associated equipment.</p>
<p><strong>It is often difficult for an average entrepreneur to keep its network up dated and maintain smooth functioning of software and other tools.</strong></p>
<p>By making the move to the cloud, entrepreneurs need not to bank upon guesswork.</p>
<figure id="attachment_861" style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><img class="wp-image-861" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GuruTransfer.com-1-1.jpg" alt="gurutransfer-com-1" width="318" height="159" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><em>itunes from the Apple store</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohitsrivastava">See LinkedIn where</a> <em>Guru Transfer </em>founder, Rohit Srivastava tells us about delivering an immediate resolution to any kind of troubleshooting and repairing issue.</p>
<p>Just like for Marsha, this enables entrepreneurs to focus more on running their business smoothly, instead of devoting time in performing research on servers and building the infrastructure.</p>
<p>What Marsha liked best is her confidence with security issues that can often be an additional expense for an entrepreneur. But the<a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"> improved productivity </a>and big savings with <em>Guru Transfer</em> overcomes the risks. This helps entrepreneurs to focus on delivering the best services which facilitates the growth of their businesses and maximize efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Being away at college and <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">staying in touch</a> with the people you have left behind can cause student blues and feeling pretty well homesick.</strong></p>
<p>Cindy left her large and close family in upstate New York for college in the UK, and realized she needed to give herself time within the university and the British environment to begin getting involved there.</p>
<p>For Cindy beginning life at college naturally generated both excitement and anxiety for many reasons, including the move. After all, just months ago she graduated from high school and with her new academic responsibilities and meeting new people certainly was stressful. But she knew she would be fine in due time.</p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJacMJqTgPI?start=33&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>To her surprise she found herself feeling homesick later in the academic year, after the Thanksgiving or semester break, and even at the start of her second academic year.</p>
<p><strong>Then Cindy found the <em>Guru Transfer</em> cloud app perfect for families.</strong></p>
<p>Families can take advantage of the ease at which you can share files, even video, using cloud storage to keep in touch with children who are away at college or family members who live out of state or abroad. Collaboration is much easier when families store their documentation in a cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/cloud-file-sharing-lighting-students-globally">A related article tells how the cloud is lighting up students globally&#8230;</a></p>
<p>Individual family members can all upload their suggestions to the cloud to make decision making more of a collaborative effort. Cloud sharing and storage also comes in useful when on a family holiday too.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1089" style="width: 193px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><img class="wp-image-1089 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/images-6-2.jpg" alt="images-6" width="193" height="262" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><em>Download the Free Guru Transfer app here</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Consider sharing files where families can take advantage of the ease at which you can share even large files.  Using cloud storage to keep in touch with children who are away at college or family members who live out of state or abroad is quick and easy.</p>
<p>Rather than having to email multiple files individually or in groups to family members, which is both time consuming for the receiver and the sender, you can send them one email with a URL on it. This will give them full access to all the files you want them to see.</p>
<p>Accidents happen, theft occurs and loss of files or devices is an eventuality, but the severity of the outcome can be limited thanks to <em>Guru Transfer</em> cloud storage.</p>
<p>Family <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">cloud storage and file sharing</a> is fantastic for making sure that not only are everyone&#8217;s documents safe, but also that you can keep in touch with ease.</p>
<p><strong>With Cindy’s big family back home the cloud keeps the other kids still at home happy, too. </strong></p>
<p>Smartphones or tablets with access to your <em>Guru Transfer</em> cloud storage are a prime example of this. Through your cloud you can choose a film to play out to keep your children happy whilst on a long car journey.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1090" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><img class="wp-image-1090" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/images-3-4.jpg" alt="images-3" width="280" height="146" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><em>itunes from the Apple store</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohitsrivastava">Pop over to LinkedIn</a> and see GuruTransfer.co founder, Rohit Srivastava explain more.</p>
<p>Cloud storage is the easiest way for Cindy away at college abroad to keep in touch with her parents and her dear Grandma, and to share pictures or video of the holiday happenings with everyone.</p>
<p>Automated backup can ensure that all your family’s devices backup to the same cloud with no manual effort required. Keep in mind that accidents do happen, theft occurs and loss of files or devices is an eventuality, but the severity of the outcome can be limited thanks to <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/"><em>Guru Transfer</em></a> cloud storage and file sharing.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">Cloud storage</a> is not just the perfect file-sharing tool, but consider backup in the event of disaster.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve recently seen evacuations underway in parts of San Jose, California, due to severe flooding and the Oroville Dam spillway crisis. This threatened cities and towns in Northern California, and it&#8217;s clear that the future will likely have many natural disaster threats yet to come.</p>
<p><strong>The United States government last year issued 103 federal disaster declarations across the country.</strong></p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJacMJqTgPI?start=33&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>And for those that suffered a loss in such an area, or a casualty or theft loss in another situation, those losses may qualify for tax deductions, according to the American Institute of CPAs, or AICPA.</p>
<p><strong>What about recuperation from important data loss, such as all the files they had backed up in hard drives and zip drives?</strong></p>
<p>That said, consider the case of Ellen and Ralph when their old beach front home burnt to the ground from faulty electrical wiring.  Ralph worked diligently following his retirement to renovate the home on stilts surrounded by acres and acres of rocks and wild sea oats hosting the surf. They’d planned to live their golden years there.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1416" style="width: 290px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><img class="wp-image-1416" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/images-10.jpg" alt="images-10" width="290" height="163" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/mobile"><em>Get the Free Guru Transfer app here</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Think about your own situation and how may those files be retrieved when not just a flood or fire, but in any type disaster drowning or blowing away and flat out destroying those important devices you’ve been using for backup?</p>
<p>A casualty loss may be taken as an itemized deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040 for the year when the damage occurred (if a taxpayer doesn&#8217;t itemize, then they can&#8217;t even get the deduction).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a grand giveaway,&#8221; said, a CPA and partner at large accounting firm in Louisiana, where flooding often occurs. But even with the best tax deductions for such a loss, still, how may you ever replace that important computer data?</p>
<p><strong>Cloud storage is the perfect <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/">file-sharing tool</a>, especially for multimedia and documents files that are too large to send by email.</strong></p>
<p>Whether you need a reliable data backup solution, instant access to files wherever you are or a simple way to share files with colleagues and clients&#8211;or all of the above&#8211; there is a cloud storage service for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/entrepreneurs-everywhere-skyrocketing-cloud">Another popular article shows readers how everyday people as well as entrepreneurs are heading to the cloud&#8230;</a></p>
<p>This gives not only everyday folks, but also small businesses like a mom and pop shops the flexibility of cloud storage and file sharing options. The benefits are instant storage for your everyday needs, sharing and storage for files to and from anywhere on the planet, especially secured during disaster.</p>
<p><strong><em>Guru Transfer</em></strong><strong> is a simple, secure and fast online storage provider.</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_1415" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><img class="wp-image-1415 size-full" src="https://www.gurutransfer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/images-2-3.jpg" alt="images-2" width="225" height="225" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1143834053?mt=8"><em>itunes from the Apple store</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <em>Guru Transfer</em> app allows for files easily accessible from anywhere and at any time, even after a flood or fire or any other disaster you can imagine, and offers unlimited storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rohitsrivastava">See LinkedIn where</a> <em>GuruTransfer.com</em> founder, Rohit Srivastava explains that you will have 100 percent automated backups and the ability to sync multiple computers and mobile device apps.</p>
<p>In other words, no matter how nice the IRS is to you following a disaster, they won’t have a magic wand to restore the data in those damaged hard drives.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.gurutransfer.com/"><em>Guru Transfer </em></a>simply browse the files and folders on your mobile or smartphone and copy even large files as often as you’d like, and they are secured.</p>
